    "\n",
    "A **position weight matrix (PWM)**, also known as a position-specific weight matrix (PSWM) or position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), is a commonly used representation of motifs (patterns) in biological sequences. They can be used for either DNA motifs or protein motifs. PSSM is the term used more often for proteins and PWM more often for DNA. I'll be using PWM in this lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "PWMs are often derived from a set of aligned sequences that are thought to be functionally related and have become an important part of many software tools for computational motif discovery. The position weight matrix was introduced by Gary Stormo and colleagues in 1982 as an alternative to consensus sequences. A **consensus** sequence (or canonical sequence) is the most frequent residues, either nucleotide or amino acid, found at each position in a sequence alignment.\n",

    "### Probability under a motif model\n",
    "Both PPMs and PWMs assume statistical independence between positions in the motif, as the probabilities for each position are calculated independently of other positions. From the definition above, it follows that the sum of values for a particular position in a PPM (that is, summing over all symbols) is 1. Each column can therefore be regarded as an independent multinomial distribution.  \n",

    "The **multinomial distribution** is a generalization of the binomial distribution.  For *n* independent trials each of which leads to a success for exactly one of *k* categories, with each category having a given fixed success probability, the multinomial distribution gives the probability of any particular combination of numbers of successes for the various categories.  \n",

    "## Expectation Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in a statistical model, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables. The EM iteration alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E step. These parameter-estimates are then used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next E step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding motifs\n",
    "\n",
    "In motif finding, the goal is to find a motif (PWM) that is over-represented in a set of sequences. While this is trivial to do when looking for DNA words, it is more complicated when we incorporate degeneracy that PWMs naturally handle. \n",
    "\n",
    "In motif finding there are two sets of unknown quantities:\n",
    "- we don't know the PWM\n",
    "- we don't know the positions of the motif\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the maximum likelihood of the PWM and the motif positions is generally not tractable analytically (through derivatives) or computationally through an exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EM Algorithm** provides a simple, efficient means of finding the PWM and the positions of PWM matches. It does so through a greedy algorithm, and hence only gaurantees a local optimum. However, by using multiple starting points it works pretty well.\n",

    "Given the statistical model which generates a set $ X $ of observed data, a set of unobserved latent data or missing values $ Z $, and a vector of unknown parameters $ \\theta $, along with a likelihood function:  \n",

    "$  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of motif finding, $X$ is the observed sequences, $Z$ is the unknown motif positions, and $\\theta$ is the motif model (PWM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The EM algorithm seeks to find the MLE of the marginal likelihood by iteratively applying these two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expectation step (E step): Calculate the expected value of the log likelihood function, with respect to the conditional distribution of $Z$ given $X$ under the current estimate of the parameters $ \\theta $:  \n",

    "In the context of motif finding, the Expectation of Z can be found by calculating the probability of the motif at each position. Initial values of $ \\theta $, the PWM, can be obtained by initializing with random values or with an over-represented DNA word.\n",
    "\n",

    "Once the probability of a motif at each position is known, we can estimate a new PWM based on these probabilities. Its important to note that we don't pick the most likely position of the PWM in each sequence. Rather, when we update the PWM we use all positions weighted by their probability of being a motif.\n",
